# Changelog

The minor version (after the dot) is an integer counter that increments by 1 each change: 0.1, 0.2 ... 0.9, 0.10, 0.11, and so on. The major version (before the dot) is NOT auto-incremented — it only advances when the user manually declares a milestone.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-08-10
### Add version field to /healthz
- Plan: expose the current CHANGELOG version in the health check response so a running deployment can be verified against CHANGELOG.md.
  - Add an `APP_VERSION` constant in `server.js` set to `'0.13'`.
  - Update the `GET /healthz` handler to return `{ status: 'ok', version: APP_VERSION }` instead of `{ status: 'ok' }`.
  - Update the existing `test/stage3.test.js` healthz test (which asserts an exact body match) and add an assertion that the response includes `status: 'ok'` and a string `version`.
